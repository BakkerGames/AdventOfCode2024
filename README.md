# AdventOfCode2024

This is a set of solutions to the puzzles on the [Advent Of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) website.

The "Input" folder contains test sets of data for each day, as well as the data given to myself for use in solving. Every person's set of data is different, so answers are different too (except for random collisions).

The "Puzzles" folder contains the puzzles by day. Each day only Part 1 is shown until you solve it correctly, then Part 2 is shown. I have captured these pages after solving, so they show my personal answers using my data.

These are all (so far) solved using C#.
